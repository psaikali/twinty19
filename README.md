# TwintyNineteen, a TwentyNineteen twin theme for WordPress

*Disclaimer:* this child theme is not ready-to-use yet, as parent theme is still in active development.

![WIP](http://media.mosaika.fr/d67ffc42cdcd/Capture%2525202018-10-23%252520a%2525CC%252580%25252009.49.47.jpg)

This theme is a work-in-progress, done closely with TwentyNineteen development.
It is developed with my personal use in mind but is made available here.

The main focus for this theme is:
- rethinking the header and page title in order to have a consistent visual experience
- adding a dynamic/customizable content in the top section of the frontpage
- making the theme work perfectly with my [WP Timeliner plugin](https://github.com/psaikali/wp-timeliner)
