# TwintyNineteen, a TwentyNineteen twin theme for WordPress

**Disclaimer:** this child theme is not ready to be used in production yet, as its [parent theme](https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen) is still in active development.

![WIP](http://media.mosaika.fr/d67ffc42cdcd/Capture%2525202018-10-23%252520a%2525CC%252580%25252009.49.47.jpg)

This theme is a **work-in-progress**. It is developed meanwhile TwentyNineteen is being developed too, and major changes happen daily.
It is developed for my personal use in mind but is made available here for anyone to use. It will be used as a portfolio/resume/blog theme on my [own website](https://saika.li) soon.

The main reasons for this theme to exist are:
- rethinking the header and page title in order to have a consistent visual experience (no blank header)
- adding a dynamic/customizable content in the top section of the frontpage
- making the theme work perfectly with my [WP Timeliner plugin](https://github.com/psaikali/wp-timeliner)
